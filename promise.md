I'm not dumb.
I'll never use my private key associated with real money in plain text
It's just a dumb way to get hacked.

This is a note to remind u to never use .env in production code or dealing with real money.
Use the --interactive option and past your private key or use keystore with foundry or some external third party.
Or use something like thirdweb deploy.
